## What I Learned

The Memory Game project was a fun project that helped me further my understanding of Javascript. As I completed various stages of my project, I got more confident with my ability to troubleshoot my code and implement fixes. 

[Mike Wales' tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y) helped me become more confident in event listeners. He helped teach me how to open the cards, match them, and flip them back over.

I reached out to other FEND students on the Udacity Grow with Google Slack channel for advice on timer issues, removing stars after a certain number of moves, etc.

I also used various tutorials from W3schools.com. The [Modal tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp) was very helpful in creating my own version.
